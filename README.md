# r-programming
All the code for the R Programming course on Coursera offered by JHU. The link to the course is here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/home/welcome.

I've been taking a course on R programming at school so this course is relatively easy for me. It is definitely not a complete cover of R programming. However, lexical scoping/closure is covered in one of the homework, which is interesting.

The code worked for the homework but you know it is far from perfect.
